/**
 * Makes a sandbox describe its own workspace, instead of being described from
 * outside.
 *
 * A cloud workspace's sandbox holds exactly one project and one workspace, and
 * both are known before it boots: they are what it was provisioned for. The
 * first version of this reached into the sandbox from the API afterwards —
 * write a seed script, run it against host.db with better-sqlite3, hope the
 * shapes still match. That put the schema in two places and made provisioning
 * a sequence of remote-exec steps that each needed a wait.
 *
 * Reading the same facts from the environment here is the same work with none
 * of the choreography: the API's whole job becomes "start a sandbox with these
 * env vars". Idempotent, so a restart is a no-op.
