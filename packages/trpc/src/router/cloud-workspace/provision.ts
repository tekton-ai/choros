 * nobody waits on the provider (about a second warm; tens of seconds when the
 * image still has to be pulled). That means it owns the row's terminal state:
 * it must leave `ready` or `failed` behind, because nothing else ever looks at
 * a `provisioning` row.
 *
 * Safe to run twice on the same row: the provider calls are create-if-missing
 * and an already-`ready` row is left alone, so a retried delivery costs a
 * couple of no-op API calls rather than a second sandbox.
