// Ratchet: src/server is imported by the Electron main process (the desktop
// chat-service / chat-runtime-service tRPC routers), so blocking calls here
// stall every electronTrpc response — the desktop app's own
// no-main-process-blocking ratchet cannot see across the package boundary.
//
// Counts are per-file matching-line counts, not a file allowlist, so an
// already-listed file cannot silently grow new call sites. Patterns match
// bare identifiers (not just calls) so renamed imports and passed-around
// references count too. Two failure modes, both intentional:
//  - a file exceeds its count → new blocking call site; make it async (or
//    move it off the main process) instead of bumping the number.
//  - a file drops below its count → it was partially or fully fixed;
//    LOWER or DELETE its entry so the ratchet only ever tightens.
