/**
 * Assigns the new-workspace-screen experiment arm. Calls `getFeatureFlag`
 * imperatively (not `useFeatureFlagVariantKey`) so the `$feature_flag_called`
 * exposure event fires only when a user actually reaches the new-workspace
 * surface — never on app load.
 *
 * Eligibility (new accounts only) lives on the flag itself: a release
 * condition on the `created_at` person property, which the renderer sends
 * with flag requests at identify time (PostHogUserIdentifier). Ineligible
 * accounts — and old builds that never send `created_at` — get `false` back,
 * which renders control; a non-variant response is not counted as experiment
 * exposure.
 *
 * The override flag short-circuits everything: it forces the screen without
 * ever evaluating the experiment flag, so overridden users (team, dev
 * accounts) emit no experiment exposure and cannot contaminate results.
 *
 * Returns null while unresolved (evaluation happens in a layout effect on the
 * first open, so consumers can render nothing for that pre-paint frame instead
 * of flashing the wrong arm).
